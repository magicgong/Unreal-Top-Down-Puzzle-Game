# Unreal-Top-Down-Puzzle-Game
A bare-bones top down puzzle game with a tilemap implemented in Unreal (using Blueprints).

Just an example puzzle game to use as a starting point for 3D top down tile-based games. 

## Usage

1. Load Map1 that is located in the TopDownPuzzleGame/Maps folder.
2. Play it.

That's it!

While in game:

Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C and the numpad keys move the character.

Ice (blue tiles) continues to move the character in the same direction (sliding).

Don't land in the fire (red tiles) or you lose the game!

Make it to the steps to win the game.

Enjoy!
